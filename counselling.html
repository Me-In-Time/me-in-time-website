        <h2>Counselling in Manchester or Online</h2>
        <p>Sometimes we just need space — to breathe, to speak freely, and to feel truly heard. Counselling offers that space. Whether you’re navigating a specific challenge or holding something harder to name, this is time set aside for you: to explore, reflect, and begin to make sense of things at your own pace.</p>

    <h2>A Calm, Grounded Approach</h2>
    <p>I work integratively, drawing from a range of therapeutic approaches, but my work is always rooted in a person-centred foundation. That means we begin where you are — with no assumptions, no pressure, and no rush. I won’t diagnose or analyse you from a distance. Instead, we’ll build understanding together, in a relationship based on trust, safety, and respect.</p>

        <h2>Some of the Things We Might Explore</h2>
        <p>Sometimes we all need space to talk things through — to sit with the big, difficult questions and not have to face them alone.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Feeling anxious, low, or overwhelmed</li>
          <li>Grief and loss</li>
          <li>Low self-esteem or a harsh inner critic</li>
          <li>Relationship difficulties</li>
          <li>Questions around identity, purpose, or direction</li>
          <li>Men’s mental health and the things that often go unsaid</li>

      <h2>Practicalities</h2>
      <p>Sessions last 50 minutes and are usually held weekly (though fortnightly can be arranged if that suits you better). I offer both in-person and online appointments.</p>
      <p><strong>Fee:</strong> £60 per session. A limited number of lower-cost spaces are available — please ask if this would help.</p>
      <p>If you’d like to arrange an initial session or simply talk things through, please <a href="contact.html">get in touch</a>.</p>

      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

      <details>
        <summary>What kind of counselling do you offer?</summary>
        <p>I work integratively, which means I draw on a range of therapeutic approaches. But my core is person-centred — so our work is led by you, not a manual. It’s collaborative, respectful, and paced around what you need.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What’s the difference between counselling and coaching?</summary>
        <p>Good question — they can overlap, but generally counselling focuses on healing, reflection and emotional insight, while coaching is more future-oriented, helping you make decisions or move through transitions. If you’re unsure, I’m happy to talk it through.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>How much do sessions cost?</summary>
        <p>Sessions are £60 and last 50 minutes. Some lower-cost spaces are available, especially for those on reduced income — just ask if that would help.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Do you offer online sessions?</summary>
        <p>Yes — I work both in person and online. Some people like to mix and match depending on what’s happening in their week.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What if I’m not sure this is right for me?</summary>
        <p>You don’t have to decide everything at once. An initial session can be a gentle way to see how it feels. There’s no pressure to continue if it doesn’t feel right.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What happens in the first session?</summary>
        <p>We’ll talk about what’s bringing you here and what you’d like from the process. It’s also a chance for you to get a sense of whether you’d like to work with me — that matters just as much.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Is everything confidential?</summary>
        <p>Yes — confidentiality is central to the work. There are a few exceptions (e.g. if there’s serious risk to you or someone else), which I’ll explain clearly before we start.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Can I stop at any time?</summary>
        <p>Absolutely. You’re not tied in, and you can pause or end whenever feels right. We can also talk about what a thoughtful ending might look like if that’s helpful.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>I’m worried about opening up too much. Is that okay?</summary>
        <p>It’s completely okay. We go at your pace, and there’s no expectation to share more than feels manageable. Trust takes time, and I’ll meet you with patience and care.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Do you work with men specifically?</summary>
        <p>Yes — I have a particular interest in men’s mental health and the things that often go unsaid. That said, I work with adults of all genders, backgrounds, and experiences.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>How often are sessions?</summary>
        <p>Most clients come weekly, but we can also explore fortnightly sessions if that’s more sustainable for you. We’ll agree what works best together.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What if I can’t afford it every week?</summary>
        <p>Let’s talk about it. I want therapy to be accessible where possible, and I’m open to discussing flexible options if you're committed but cost is a barrier.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Where are you based?</summary>
        <p>I’m based in Manchester and offer in-person sessions in a comfortable, quiet space. Online sessions are available to clients across the UK.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>How do I get started?</summary>
        <p>Just <a href="contact.html">get in touch</a> — you can email, call, text or WhatsApp me. I’ll reply as soon as I can, and we’ll take it from there.</p>

        <h1>Welcome to Me In Time</h1>
        <p>Hi, and thanks for dropping by.
        I know that even just visiting a site like this can take something — courage, curiosity, or maybe a quiet sense that something needs to shift. If you're here, it’s probably because something matters to you right now.</p>

        <p>Maybe you’re feeling overwhelmed, stuck, or simply tired of carrying things alone. Maybe you're not sure what you're looking for — only that you’d like somewhere to land for a while.</p>

        <p>Me In Time is a space for just that.</p>

        <p>No pressure. No rush. Just a place where you can pause, breathe, and be met with honesty, care, and real support — whether that’s through counselling, coaching, or simply taking the first step.</p>

        <p>You don’t have to have all the answers.<br>
        You don’t even need to have the questions.</p>

        <p>You're welcome here, as you are.<br>
        Take your time. Look around. And if something feels right, I’d love to hear from you.</p>

        <h2>Start Where You Are</h2>
        <p>Whether you're exploring coaching, considering counselling, or simply have questions — you don’t need to have it all figured out to begin. There’s no pressure here, no judgement — just space to pause, reflect, and feel heard. If something inside you is quietly saying “maybe now,” I’m here to listen.</p>
