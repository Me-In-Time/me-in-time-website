        <h1>Counselling with Me In Time</h1>
<p>Sometimes, we reach a point where something needs to shift — but we don’t quite know how to begin. Maybe life feels heavy. Maybe it’s been that way for a while. Or maybe something’s happened that’s left you feeling knocked or lost. You’re not alone.</p>
<p>Counselling offers you a space to breathe. A space to speak freely, without judgement. To feel heard — really heard — and begin to make sense of what’s going on. There’s no pressure here. Just time set aside for you, at your own pace, in your own way.</p>

        <h2>A Calm, Grounded Approach</h2>
<p>I work in an integrative way — blending different approaches depending on what feels right for you. But at the heart of it all is a person-centred foundation. That means we begin wherever you are, and we build the work together.</p>
<p>This isn’t about quick fixes or being analysed from a distance. It’s about feeling safe enough to be honest. Held enough to explore what hurts. Respected enough to take your time. My aim is to offer a steady presence, so you can begin to reconnect with yourself — gently, honestly, and without masks.</p>

        <h2>What We Might Explore</h2>
<p>There’s no one reason people come to therapy. Sometimes it’s a clear event. Sometimes it’s a slow build. Often, it’s just a sense that something doesn’t feel right anymore.</p>
<p>You might be living with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Persistent anxiety, low mood, or burnout</li>
  <li>Grief, loss, or unresolved pain</li>
  <li>A harsh inner critic or low self-worth</li>
  <li>Relationship or family challenges</li>
  <li>Questions of identity, meaning, or direction</li>
  <li>Feeling stuck — and unsure why</li>
</ul>
<p>Men often tell me it’s hard to even find the words — especially when they’ve been taught to “just get on with it.” You don’t need to have the language, or the answers, to begin. We can find them together.</p>

      <h2>Practicalities</h2>
      <p>Sessions are 50 minutes and usually weekly — though we can discuss what rhythm works for you. I offer both in-person appointments in Manchester and online sessions.</p>
      <p><strong>Standard Fee:</strong> £60 per session. A limited number of lower-cost places are available — just ask if that would help.</p>
