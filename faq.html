      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

      <details>
        <summary>What kind of counselling do you offer?</summary>
        <p>I work integratively, which means I draw on a range of therapeutic approaches. But my core is person-centred — so our work is led by you, not a manual. It’s collaborative, respectful, and paced around what you need.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What’s the difference between counselling and coaching?</summary>
        <p>Good question — they can overlap, but generally counselling focuses on healing, reflection and emotional insight, while coaching is more future-oriented, helping you make decisions or move through transitions. If you’re unsure, I’m happy to talk it through.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>How much do sessions cost?</summary>
        <p>Sessions are £60 and last 50 minutes. Some lower-cost spaces are available, especially for those on reduced income — just ask if that would help.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Do you offer online sessions?</summary>
        <p>Yes — I work both in person and online. Some people like to mix and match depending on what’s happening in their week.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What if I’m not sure this is right for me?</summary>
        <p>You don’t have to decide everything at once. An initial session can be a gentle way to see how it feels. There’s no pressure to continue if it doesn’t feel right.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What happens in the first session?</summary>
        <p>We’ll talk about what’s bringing you here and what you’d like from the process. It’s also a chance for you to get a sense of whether you’d like to work with me — that matters just as much.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Is everything confidential?</summary>
        <p>Yes — confidentiality is central to the work. There are a few exceptions (e.g. if there’s serious risk to you or someone else), which I’ll explain clearly before we start.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Can I stop at any time?</summary>
        <p>Absolutely. You’re not tied in, and you can pause or end whenever feels right. We can also talk about what a thoughtful ending might look like if that’s helpful.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>I’m worried about opening up too much. Is that okay?</summary>
        <p>It’s completely okay. We go at your pace, and there’s no expectation to share more than feels manageable. Trust takes time, and I’ll meet you with patience and care.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Do you work with men specifically?</summary>
        <p>Yes — I have a particular interest in men’s mental health and the things that often go unsaid. That said, I work with adults of all genders, backgrounds, and experiences.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>How often are sessions?</summary>
        <p>Most clients come weekly, but we can also explore fortnightly sessions if that’s more sustainable for you. We’ll agree what works best together.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What if I can’t afford it every week?</summary>
        <p>Let’s talk about it. I want therapy to be accessible where possible, and I’m open to discussing flexible options if you're committed but cost is a barrier.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Where are you based?</summary>
        <p>I’m based in Manchester and offer in-person sessions in a comfortable, quiet space. Online sessions are available to clients across the UK.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>How do I get started?</summary>
        <p>Just <a href="contact.html">get in touch</a> — you can email, call, text or WhatsApp me. I’ll reply as soon as I can, and we’ll take it from there.</p>
