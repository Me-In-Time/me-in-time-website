        <h1>Coaching with Me In Time</h1>
        <p>Coaching is about getting unstuck — gently, honestly, and at your own pace. It offers a reflective space to name what matters, explore what’s in the way, and move forward in a way that feels grounded and real. No hype. No hustle. Just support that meets you where you are.</p>

        <h2>Not Just Goals — Direction</h2>
        <p>This isn’t about setting 10-year plans or “fixing” what’s wrong. It’s about paying attention to what’s already there — the small nudges, the quiet frustrations, the parts of you that are ready to move. Coaching can help you listen more closely, act more intentionally, and live in a way that feels more like you.</p>

        <h2>What We Might Work On</h2>
        <p>People come to coaching for all sorts of reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Making a decision or navigating change</li>
          <li>Feeling stuck, restless, or unsure what's next</li>
          <li>Exploring purpose, creativity, or identity</li>
          <li>Wanting to show up differently in work, life, or relationships</li>
          <li>Reconnecting with confidence, voice, or ideas</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some come for a one-off Clarity Session. Others stay longer. We’ll work together in the way that suits you best.</p>

      <h2>What Does It Involve?</h2>
      <p>Coaching sessions last 60 minutes and are usually spaced fortnightly or monthly, depending on what feels helpful for you. We can meet online or in-person in Manchester — whichever suits your rhythm and routine.</p>
      <p><strong>Standard Fee:</strong> £70 per session. I also offer a longer, one-off 90-minute “Clarity Session” for £90 — a deeper dive if you're facing a specific decision or feeling stuck.</p>
      <p>If you're curious or simply want to talk things through, you’re welcome to <a href="contact.html">get in touch</a>. There's no pressure — just a chance to explore whether this feels like the right fit for you.</p>
