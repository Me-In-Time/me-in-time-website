        <h1>Coaching with Me In Time</h1>
        <p>Coaching is about getting unstuck ‚Äî gently, honestly, and at your own pace. It offers a reflective space to name what matters, explore what‚Äôs in the way, and move forward in a way that feels grounded and real. No hype. No hustle. Just support that meets you where you are.</p>

        <h2>Not Just Goals ‚Äî Direction</h2>
        <p>This isn‚Äôt about setting 10-year plans or ‚Äúfixing‚Äù what‚Äôs wrong. It‚Äôs about paying attention to what‚Äôs already there ‚Äî the small nudges, the quiet frustrations, the parts of you that are ready to move. Coaching can help you listen more closely, act more intentionally, and live in a way that feels more like you.</p>
