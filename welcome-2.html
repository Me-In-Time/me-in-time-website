        <h1>Welcome | Counselling & Coaching in Manchester & Online – Me In Time</h1>
        <h2>Thanks for stopping by.</h2>
        <p>Whether you’re here because you’re struggling, curious about therapy or coaching, or just thinking things through — I hope this space feels calm, grounded, and genuinely welcoming. Me In Time is about creating room for reflection, growth, and real connection. No pressure. No judgement. Just time for you, as you are.</p>

        <h2>Why “Me In Time”?</h2>
        <p>Because we all need a moment to find ourselves — not just who we were, or who we feel we should be, but who we are now. This practice is named after that idea: that given space, support, and time, we begin to meet ourselves more gently. And from there, new things become possible.</p>

        <h2>Helping You Put It All Together</h2>
        <p>Maybe you’re at a crossroads. Or maybe you’ve just taken a wrong turn.</p>
        <p>Therapy and coaching don’t always start with a crisis — sometimes they begin with a quiet sense that things could be different. That something isn’t sitting right. That you’ve lost track of yourself a little. If that’s where you are, you’re not alone.</p>
        <p>This is a place where you can take a breath, figure things out, and pull together the pieces that matter most. Whether that’s sorting through feelings, finding clarity in chaos, or just giving yourself space to make sense of things.</p>

        <h2>You Don’t Have to Be a Superhero</h2>
        <p>Sometimes we all feel like we need to be a superhero. Especially for men, there's often this unspoken pressure to keep going, stay strong, and carry it all quietly. To be stoic. Capable. In control.</p>
        <p>But you don’t have to be.</p>
        <p>Therapy and coaching offer a different kind of strength — one that comes from honesty, reflection, and allowing yourself to be human. You don’t have to carry it all alone.</p>

        <h2>You Don’t Have to Walk It All Alone</h2>
        <p>This isn’t about quick fixes. It’s about walking alongside you as you find your own pace, path, and clarity.</p>
        <p>Whether we’re working through grief, overwhelm, identity, or simply making space to breathe again — I’ll meet you with warmth, honesty, and respect.</p>

        <h2>For You and Yours</h2>
        <p>Maybe you’re a father trying to be there for your kids while navigating your own challenges. Maybe you’re carrying more than anyone realises.</p>
        <p>This space is for you.</p>
        <p>A place to pause. To reconnect. To feel supported.</p>
        <p>Wherever you’re starting from, you're welcome here.</p>
