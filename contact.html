        <h2>Not Sure Where to Start?</h2>
        <p>
          Reaching out can feel like a big step â€” and thatâ€™s okay. You donâ€™t need to have everything worked out. 
          Whether you're curious about counselling, thinking about coaching, or simply want to be heard, Iâ€™ll meet you where you are.
          No pressure, no judgement â€” just space to talk things through.

<h2>Your Privacy & Safety Matter</h2>
<p>
  Choosing to reach out is a meaningful step â€” and I want you to feel confident that your privacy and wellbeing are in safe hands.
  I take my responsibilities seriously, and I'm committed to creating a space where trust can grow. That means being clear about how your information is handled, and the standards I work to.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>DBS Checked</strong> â€” I hold a current enhanced DBS certificate, cleared to work with adults, children, and young people.</li>
  <li><strong>BACP Registered</strong> â€” As a <a href="https://www.bacp.co.uk/about-us/contact-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">member of the BACP</a>, I work within their <a href="https://www.bacp.co.uk/events-and-resources/ethics-and-standards/ethical-framework-for-the-counselling-professions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethical Framework</a> â€” which prioritises integrity, care, and professional boundaries.</li>
  <li><strong>ICO Registered</strong> â€” I'm registered with the <a href="https://ico.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)</a>, which means Iâ€™m legally accountable for handling your data securely and transparently.</li>
  <li><strong>GDPR Compliant</strong> â€” In line with the <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a>, any personal information you share is kept confidential, never passed on, and only used for legitimate purposes related to our work together.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="privacy.html">Privacy & Confidentiality Policy</a></strong> â€” This outlines in plain terms how I store, protect, and manage your information, and your rights as a client.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  In short: I treat your contact with me â€” and anything we explore together â€” with the same respect and care Iâ€™d hope for myself.
