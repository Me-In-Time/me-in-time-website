Hi, and thanks for dropping by.
I know that even just visiting a site like this can take something — courage, curiosity, or maybe a quiet sense that something needs to shift. If you're here, it’s probably because something matters to you right now.

Maybe you’re feeling overwhelmed, stuck, or simply tired of carrying things alone. Maybe you're not sure what you're looking for — only that you’d like somewhere to land for a while.

Me In Time is a space for just that.

No pressure. No rush. Just a place where you can pause, breathe, and be met with honesty, care, and real support — whether that’s through counselling, coaching, or simply taking the first step.

You don’t have to have all the answers.
You don’t even need to have the questions.

You're welcome here, as you are.
Take your time. Look around. And if something feels right, I’d love to hear from you.

        <h2>Start Where You Are</h2>
        <p>Whether you're exploring coaching, considering counselling, or simply have questions — you don’t need to have it all figured out to begin. There’s no pressure here, no judgement — just space to pause, reflect, and feel heard. If something inside you is quietly saying “maybe now,” I’m here to listen.
