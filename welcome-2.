          <h1>Welcome to Me In Time</h1>
          <p>Thanks for stopping by. Whether you’re here because you’re struggling, curious about therapy or coaching, or just thinking things through — I hope this space feels calm, grounded, and genuinely welcoming. Me In Time is about creating room for reflection, growth, and real connection. No pressure. No judgement. Just time for you, as you are.</p>

          <h2>Maybe You’re at a Crossroads</h2>
          <p>Or maybe you’ve just taken a wrong turn. Therapy and coaching don’t always start with a crisis — sometimes they begin with a quiet sense that things could be different. That something isn’t sitting right. That you’ve lost track of yourself a little. If that’s where you are, you’re not alone.</p>

          <h2>You Don’t Have to Walk It All Alone</h2>
          <p>This isn’t about quick fixes. It’s about walking alongside you as you find your own pace, path, and clarity. Whether we’re working through grief, overwhelm, identity, or simply making space to breathe again — I’ll meet you with warmth, honesty, and respect.</p>

        <h2>Why “Me In Time”?</h2>
        <p>Because we all need a moment to find ourselves — not just who we were, or who we feel we should be, but who we are now. This practice is named after that idea: that given space, support, and time, we begin to meet ourselves more gently. And from there, new things become possible.</p>
