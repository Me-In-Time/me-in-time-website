# Me In Time – Personal Website

This is the personal website for Stuart Walker’s counselling and coaching practice, *Me In Time*.

All content has been created and uploaded by me. I’ve used ChatGPT to support the structure, writing, and technical setup — but all final decisions, edits, and uploads are mine.

This site is built using HTML and CSS and hosted with GitHub Pages.
