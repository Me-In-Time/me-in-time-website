    <h1>Privacy, Confidentiality & Ethical Practice</h1>

    <p>Your trust matters. This page outlines how I protect your personal information, uphold your autonomy, and meet the ethical standards of professional therapy and coaching practice.</p>

    <h2>Purpose of Data Collection</h2>
    <p>I collect personal data to provide therapy or coaching, contact clients about appointments, manage billing, and maintain secure records in line with professional standards.</p>

    <h2>Types of Data Collected</h2>
    <p>Data may include your name, contact information, session notes, referral details, background information shared in sessions, and any communication exchanged as part of our work together.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Your information is securely stored — either digitally (with encrypted systems and password protection) or on paper (in locked cabinets). Only I have access unless legally required otherwise.</p>

    <h2>Confidentiality and Exceptions</h2>
    <p>With the exception of certain specific situations as described below, you have the absolute right to the confidentiality of your therapy. I cannot and will not tell anyone else what you have told me, or even that you are in therapy with me, without your prior permission. You can authorise me to share information with whomever you choose, and you may change your mind and revoke that permission at any time.</p>

    <p>The following are legal exceptions to confidentiality. I will always aim to inform you first if any of these need to be enacted:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If I have good reason to believe that you will harm another person, I must attempt to inform that person and contact the police.</li>
      <li>If I have good reason to believe that you are abusing or neglecting a child or vulnerable adult (including elder abuse), I must report this to safeguarding services — Child Protective Services within 48 hours, and Adult Protective Services immediately.</li>
      <li>If I believe that you are in imminent danger of seriously harming yourself, I may legally break confidentiality to contact emergency services. This is not automatic — I will explore all other options with you first wherever possible.</li>
      <li>If I am compelled to share information by a court order or legal investigation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Confidentiality for Children and Young People</h3>
    <p>Therapy with young clients (under 18) is also confidential. However, I may use my professional judgement to share relevant insights with parents or carers where it supports the young person’s wellbeing. I aim to do this in collaboration with the young person where appropriate.</p>

    <h2>Client Rights</h2>
    <p>You have rights under GDPR, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Accessing the data I hold about you</li>
      <li>Correcting inaccurate or incomplete data</li>
      <li>Requesting data deletion where appropriate</li>
      <li>Objecting to certain uses of your data</li>
      <li>Withdrawing consent where it applies</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Client records are kept securely for 7 years after our work ends. After this period, they are confidentially destroyed in accordance with professional guidance.</p>

    <h2>Sharing of Data</h2>
    <p>Data is never sold or shared for marketing. It may be shared:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>With your explicit written consent (e.g. to contact your GP)</li>
      <li>Where required by law or in safeguarding circumstances</li>
      <li>In anonymised form within clinical supervision to maintain ethical standards</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Supervision</h2>
    <p>I access regular professional supervision as part of ethical practice. Client material is anonymised so identities are protected. Supervision supports safe, ethical, and reflective work.</p>

    <h2>Therapy Process, Risks & Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>Therapy involves an active, collaborative effort. There may be emotional risks in exploring difficult memories or making changes. However, many people find that therapy leads to greater clarity, improved relationships, and reduced distress. You are always free to agree or disagree with any recommendations.</p>

    <h2>Appointments</h2>
    <p>Sessions usually last 50 minutes and are booked at a regular weekly time. If you need to cancel, please give at least 24 hours’ notice by phone or text. Missed sessions without notice may be charged at the full fee. If you are late, sessions will still finish at the scheduled time.</p>

    <h2>Termination of Therapy</h2>
    <p>You may end therapy at any time. Ideally, we plan this together to support a thoughtful ending. If I believe a different service would better support you, I may also suggest referrals or changes to our work.</p>

    <h2>GDPR Compliance</h2>
    <p>I adhere to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all applicable UK data laws. Learn more at <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu" target="_blank">gdpr-info.eu</a>.</p>

    <h2>Safeguarding & DBS</h2>
    <p>I hold enhanced DBS clearance to work with adults, children, and young people. I follow safeguarding protocols in all areas of practice, including regular training and review.</p>

    <h2>Ethical Framework</h2>
    <p>I'm a registered member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) and work in line with their <a href="https://www.bacp.co.uk/about-us/protecting-the-public/" target="_blank">ethical framework</a>. This includes core values of trust, autonomy, justice, and accountability.</p>

    <h2>Neurodivergent Inclusion</h2>
    <p>I actively welcome neurodivergent clients. Sessions can be adapted to your needs — from sensory preferences to communication style, pacing, or how we structure our work. You're welcome as you are.</p>

    <h2>Transparency & Accessibility</h2>
    <p>This policy is written in plain language to ensure it's clear and accessible. I’m happy to clarify anything further or offer this information in alternative formats if helpful.</p>

    <h2>Contact for Privacy Matters</h2>
    <p>If you have any concerns or questions about privacy, please contact me directly. You can also contact the Information Commissioner’s Office at <a href="https://ico.org.uk" target="_blank">ico.org.uk</a>.</p>
