    <h1>Privacy, Confidentiality & Ethical Practice</h1>

    <p>This privacy statement explains how your personal data is collected, used, and safeguarded as part of our therapeutic work together. It reflects my legal and ethical commitments, including GDPR compliance, safeguarding responsibilities, and inclusive practice for all clients — including those who are neurodivergent.</p>

    <h2>Why I Collect Data</h2>
    <p>Data is collected for specific purposes: arranging appointments, offering therapy or coaching, keeping records, managing billing, and ensuring the continuity and safety of your care.</p>

    <h2>Types of Data Collected</h2>
    <p>This includes your contact details, notes from our sessions, referral information, communication records, and any other information relevant to your support.</p>

    <h2>How Your Data is Stored</h2>
    <p>All data is securely stored — either encrypted digitally or locked away physically. Only I have access unless legally required to share it.</p>

    <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>With the exception of specific legal or safety-related situations outlined below, everything shared in therapy is confidential. I will not confirm you're a client or disclose any information without your written permission. You can revoke consent at any time.</p>

    <h3>Legal Exceptions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If I believe you intend to harm another person, I may need to contact them and/or the police.</li>
      <li>If there is risk of serious harm to yourself, I may involve emergency services — but only after discussing all other options with you.</li>
      <li>If I suspect abuse or neglect of a child, young person, or vulnerable adult, I am legally required to report this.</li>
      <li>If ordered by a court, I may be legally required to share relevant information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Confidentiality for Children & Young People</h3>
    <p>Sessions with clients under 18 are confidential. However, I may share relevant information with parents or carers — using professional judgement and always with the young person’s wellbeing at heart. These discussions are handled with sensitivity and transparency where possible.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights Under GDPR</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The right to access your personal data</li>
      <li>The right to request correction of inaccurate information</li>
      <li>The right to request deletion of your data (in some circumstances)</li>
      <li>The right to restrict or object to how your data is used</li>
      <li>The right to withdraw consent for data use where applicable</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Long Your Data is Kept</h2>
    <p>Records are retained securely for 7 years following the end of therapy, in accordance with professional guidance. After this, they are securely deleted or destroyed.</p>

    <h2>When Data Might Be Shared</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>With your explicit written consent (e.g., to contact your GP)</li>
      <li>If there’s a serious risk to safety, or as required by safeguarding or legal obligations</li>
      <li>In anonymised form during professional supervision</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Supervision</h2>
    <p>I discuss my work with a clinical supervisor as part of ethical practice. Any client material shared is anonymised to protect your identity.</p>

    <h2>Therapy, Consent & Risks</h2>
    <p>Therapy can bring emotional challenges. We might explore difficult topics or feelings you've long avoided. But therapy can also bring clarity, relief, and growth. Your pace is respected. You're never pressured to go further than feels safe.</p>

    <h2>Appointments & Cancellations</h2>
    <p>Sessions are typically 50 minutes long and held weekly. If you need to cancel, please give 24 hours’ notice by phone or text. Late cancellations or missed appointments may be charged at the usual rate.</p>

    <h2>Ending Therapy</h2>
    <p>You can end therapy at any time, and we’ll usually discuss a plan to support a thoughtful, well-timed ending. If therapy doesn’t seem to be the right fit, we can also explore other options or referrals.</p>

    <h2>Safeguarding & DBS</h2>
    <p>I hold enhanced DBS clearance and work safely with adults, children, and young people. I undertake regular safeguarding training and follow national guidance.</p>

    <h2>Neurodivergent Clients</h2>
    <p>I welcome neurodivergent clients and work collaboratively to adapt sessions to your needs — from pace and structure to communication style. Your preferences are respected throughout our work together.</p>

    <h2>Ethical Standards</h2>
    <p>I work in line with the <a href="https://www.bacp.co.uk/about-us/protecting-the-public/" target="_blank">BACP Ethical Framework</a> and the values of honesty, autonomy, trust, and respect.</p>

    <h2>GDPR & Your Data</h2>
    <p>This service complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Learn more at <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu" target="_blank">gdpr-info.eu</a>. If you have concerns, you may also contact the Information Commissioner’s Office at <a href="https://ico.org.uk" target="_blank">ico.org.uk</a>.</p>

    <h2>Questions or Concerns</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this policy or your privacy rights, please contact me directly. I'm happy to explain anything further or provide this information in other formats.</p>
