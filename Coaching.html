        <h1>Coaching with Me In Time</h1>
        <p>Coaching is a space to grow — to name what matters, get clearer on where you're heading, and explore what’s getting in the way. Together, we’ll create a gentle but structured space for momentum, helping you move forward in ways that feel right for you.</p>

        <h2>What's the Difference from Counselling?</h2>
        <p>In coaching, we tend to look ahead rather than inward — but there’s still space for reflection and emotion. It’s less about “fixing” and more about uncovering: What do you want your life to look like? What’s feeling stuck? What’s quietly calling your name?</p>

        <h2>Support That Fits Around You</h2>
        <p>Some clients come for a single clarity session, others for ongoing support. You might want to tackle a specific decision, find a new rhythm, or start believing in your own ideas again. Wherever you're starting from, we’ll meet there.</p>

      <h2>Practicalities</h2>
      <p>Coaching sessions last 60 minutes and are usually spaced fortnightly or monthly. I offer sessions online or in-person in Manchester.</p>
      <p><strong>Fee:</strong> £70 per session. I also offer a one-off 90-minute “Clarity Session” for £90.</p>
